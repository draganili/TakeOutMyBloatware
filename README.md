# TakeOutMyBloatware ^v^

TakeOutMyBloatware is a complete, open-source and security-oriented tool that integrates with your Windows 10 OS and makes wide system changes that include the following:

* Removing any bloatware apps that come with the system.
* Configuring your system to be privacy-oriented.
* Disable unneeded services, features etc.
* Disabling built-in antiviruses
* Uninstalling Edge, OneDrive, etc.
* Disable Telemetry, Error reporting etc.
* Disable Automatic updates, shcheduled tasks etc.
* Other...

This open-source version contains the standard plugins, but there is going to be a commercial version in future with premium plugins that will analyze the system with AI and make safe and tested changes.

(Disclaimer: Even if the tool was extensively tested and showed complete success on most of the Win10 systems, it does not guarantee anything and it can be used AS IS. Please backup your system if you don't want to risk losing anything).

Minimum Supported Version: Windows 10 - 2009 Release (20H2)

Also, please be aware that even if you remove some of the components, some cumulative update would re-install it back (if you want to use updates).
